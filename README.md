This document should guide the work of the student Guillaume Verrier. The objective of his work is to assemble the experimental setup of a hydraulic bench for teaching purposes at the thermofluids laboratory of UnB â€“ Gama Campus.

This document is not intended to go through all the steps of the work of the student. This work can be supplemented beyond a minimum requirement, stated at the assignments listed below.

Those assignments should be delivered to the teacher using the chronogram below.

Assignments:

1. Review of the theory of basic fluid mechanics, on the following topics:

  a. Internal flows;
  When a fluid is flowing inside a solid (like a pipe), depending on the parameters of the pipe the fluid can be in a laminar flow (Re<2000) or a turbulent flow (Re>5000) or in a transition flow (2000<Re<5000) depending the speed of the fluid and the geometry of the pipe. Depending the roughness of the pipe, different head losses can be observed for a fluid in movement (see below)
  
  b. Venturi tubes;
    Venturi tubes are tubes based on the venturi effect : for an internal flow, the reduction of the passage section implies a raise of the velocity and a drop of the static pressure. Venturi tubes a commonly used to check the flow rate of a fluid.
  
  c. Orifice plates;
    Orifice plates are used in order to check the flow rate. It is based on the venturi effect and it follow the Bernoulli formula. Orifice plates include a beta factor proportionnal to diameter of the flow before the orifice plate and after the same plate. It also introduce the C factor function of beta and the Cd factor (calculated by the Reader-Harris/Gallagher equation).
  
  d. Head losses;
    head losses are concequences of the action between a solid and a fluid : the friction between the fluid and the solid which contain it. head losses are closely related to the nature of the flow (laminar or turbulent). There is two type of head losses : 
    -linear head losses due to the friction between the fluid and the solid (between a pipe and the water flow inside for exemple). There is two type of linear head losse : in turbulent and laminar flow :
        -In laminar flow, the head losses follow the Darcy-Weisbach formula.
        -In turbulent flow, head losses follow the Colebrook formula.
    -singular head losses due to the presence of singularity inside a circuit (valve, elbow...) 
  
  e. Bernoulli equation;
    Bernoulli's equations are fundamental equation of the fluid mechanics. Those equations can be applied if the fluid is considered homogeneous, incompressible, Newtonian and also in a stationary movement. Two equation exist the one for a perfect fluid and the other one for real fluids. 
  
  f. Fundamentals of Aerodynamics and Wind Tunnels;
    in aerodynamics the two main forces are the lift and drag forces, the lift force is perpendicular to the flow of fluid        around a solid (air flow around an aircraft for exemple) the drag force is opposed to the movement of the solid. 
    Due to the limitation of a wind tunneln in order to create a similar flow around a model and around a real aircraft, condition of similarity must be respected (same Reynold's number for each model)
