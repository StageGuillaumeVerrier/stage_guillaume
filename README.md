This document should guide the work of the student Guillaume Verrier. The objective of his work is to assemble the experimental setup of a hydraulic bench for teaching purposes at the thermofluids laboratory of UnB â€“ Gama Campus.

This document is not intended to go through all the steps of the work of the student. This work can be supplemented beyond a minimum requirement, stated at the assignments listed below.

Those assignments should be delivered to the teacher using the chronogram below.

Assignments:

1. Review of the theory of basic fluid mechanics, on the following topics:

  a. Internal flows;
  
  b. Venturi tubes;
  
  c. Orifice plates;
  
  d. Head losses;
  
  e. Bernoulli equation;
  
  f. Fundamentals of Aerodynamics and Wind Tunnels;

2.	Review of basic instrumentation required for experiments on the topics present at assignment 1;

3.	Measurements and CAD drawings of the hydraulic bench and the Wind Tunnel;

4.	Formulation of a minimum of 10 experiments that can be performed at the bench;

5.	Execution of the experiments of assignment 4 at the bench;

6.	Data treatment and analysis for the experiments of assignment 4 using the basic instrumentation;

7.	Writing of laboratory scripts for each experiment, containing:

  a.	Basic theory;
  
  b.	Materials and Methods;
  
  c.	Experimental procedures;
  
8.	Planning of automated data acquisition setup for the experiments at the bench and at the Wind tunnel;

9.	Assembly and testing of the data acquisition setup;

10.	Write a report for the performed work for analysis;
