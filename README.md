This document should guide the work of the student Guillaume Verrier. The objective of his work is to assemble the experimental setup of a hydraulic bench for teaching purposes at the thermofluids laboratory of UnB â€“ Gama Campus.

This document is not intended to go through all the steps of the work of the student. This work can be supplemented beyond a minimum requirement, stated at the assignments listed below.

Those assignments should be delivered to the teacher using the chronogram below.

Assignments:

1. Review of the theory of basic fluid mechanics, on the following topics:

  a. Internal flows;
  When a fluid is flowing inside a solide (like a pipe), depending on the parametres of the pipe the fluid can be in a laminar flow (Re<2000) or a turbulent flow (Re>5000) or in a transition flow (2000<Re<5000). Depending the roughness of the pipe, different head losses can be observed for a fluid in movement (see below)
  
  b. Venturi tubes;
    Venturi tubes are tubes with a shape similar to an hourglass. they are based on the venturi effect : for an internal flow, the reduction of the passage section implie a raise of the velocity and a drop of the static pressure. Venturi tubes a commonly used to check the flow rate of a fluid.
  
  c. Orifice plates;
    Orifice plates are used in order to check the flow rate. It is based on the venturi effect and it follow the Bernoulli formula.
  
  d. Head losses;
    head losses are concequences of the action between a solid and a fluid : the friction between the fluid and the solid which contain it. head losses are closely related to the nature of the flow (laminar or turbulent). There is two type of head losses : 
    -linear head losses due to the friction between the fluid and the solid (between a pipe and the water flow inside for exemple). There is two type of linear head losse : in turbulent and laminar flow :
        -In laminar flow, the head losses follow the Darcy-Weisbach formula.
        -In turbulent flow, head losses follow the Colebrook formula.
    -singular head losses due to the presence of singularity inside a circuit (valve, elbow...) 
  
  e. Bernoulli equation;
    Bernoulli's equations are fundamental equation of the fluid mechanics. Those equations can be applied if the fluid is considered homogeneous, incompressible, Newtonian and also in a stationary movement. Two equation exist the one for a perfect fluid and the other one for real fluids. 
  
  f. Fundamentals of Aerodynamics and Wind Tunnels;
    in aerodynamics the two main forces are the lift and drag forces, the lift force is perpendicular to the flow of fluid        around a solid (air flow around an aircraft for exemple) the drag force is opposed to the movement of the solid. 
    Due to the limitation of a wind tunneln in order to create a similar flow around a model and around a real aircraft, condition of similarity must be respected (same Reynold's number for each model)

2.	Review of basic instrumentation required for experiments on the topics present at assignment 1;
  For each experiment based on the flow rate,a manometer is required, flowmeter (a rotatiometer and two U tube manometer are already equiped on the bench).
  For wind tunnel experiment, strain gauge can be used to measure both lift and drag force, a pitot tube can be used for the measurement of the air flow velocity, an anemometer can be more easy to use.

3.	Measurements and CAD drawings of the hydraulic bench and the Wind Tunnel;

4.	Formulation of a minimum of 10 experiments that can be performed at the bench;

5.	Execution of the experiments of assignment 4 at the bench;

6.	Data treatment and analysis for the experiments of assignment 4 using the basic instrumentation;

7.	Writing of laboratory scripts for each experiment, containing:

  a.	Basic theory;
  
  b.	Materials and Methods;
  
  c.	Experimental procedures;
  
8.	Planning of automated data acquisition setup for the experiments at the bench and at the Wind tunnel;

9.	Assembly and testing of the data acquisition setup;

10.	Write a report for the performed work for analysis;
