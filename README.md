This document should guide the work of the student Guillaume Verrier. The objective of his work is to assemble the experimental setup of a hydraulic bench for teaching purposes at the thermofluids laboratory of UnB â€“ Gama Campus.

This document is not intended to go through all the steps of the work of the student. This work can be supplemented beyond a minimum requirement, stated at the assignments listed below.

Those assignments should be delivered to the teacher using the chronogram below.

Assignments:

1. Review of the theory of basic fluid mechanics, on the following topics:

  a. Internal flows;
  When a fluid is flowing inside a solide (like a pipe), 
  
  b. Venturi tubes;
    Venturi tubes are tubes with a shape similar to an hourglass. they are based on the venturi effect : for an internal flow, the reduction of the passage section implie a raise of the velocity and a drop of the pressure.
  c. Orifice plates;
    Orifice plates are used in order to check the flow rate. It is based on the venturi effect and it is ruled by the Bernoulli formula.
  d. Head losses;
    head losses are concequences of the viscosity of a fluid : the friction between a fluid and the solid which contain it. head losses are closely related to the nature of the flow (laminar or turbulent). There is two type of head losses : 
    -linear head losses due to the friction between the fluid and the solid (between a pipe and the water flow inside for exemple). There is two type of linear head losse : in turbulent and laminar flow :
        -In laminar flow, the head losses follow the Darcy-Weisbach formula.
        -In turbulent flow, head losses follow the Colebrook formula.
    -singular head losses due to the presence of singularity inside a circuit (valve, elbow...) 
  
  e. Bernoulli equation;
    Bernoulli's equations are fundamental equation of the fluid mechanics. Those equations can be applied if the fluid is considered homogeneous, incompressible, newtonian and also in a stationary movement. Two equation exist the one for a perfect fluid and the other one for real fluids. 
  
  f. Fundamentals of Aerodynamics and Wind Tunnels;
    in aerodynamics the two main forces are the lift and drag forces, the lift force is perpendicular to the flow of fluid        around a solid (air flow around an aircraft for exemple) the drag force is opposed to the movement of the solid.
